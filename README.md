# Bearer Seek Seek Lest

[My Dark Souls fanpage](https://brongstein.github.io/) covers what I think about the areas, bosses, and weapons throughout the series. Felt appropriate, as all four entries in the Souls series are among my favorite games. This site was created as an assignment for learning the basics of HTML and CSS.
