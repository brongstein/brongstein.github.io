# Bearer Seek Seek Lest

This Dark Souls fanpage covers what I think about the areas, bosses, and weapons throughout the series. Felt appropriate, as all four entries in the Souls series are among my favorite games. This site was created as an assignment for learning the basics of HTML and CSS.

## About

  - __Site Creator__: Alvan 'Brongstein' Ung
  - __Sensei__: Rick 'VeysonD' Gallegos

## Tech

This site is powered by HTML5 and CSS4. Website created through Github's browser interface, as well as Github through Linux terminal (PopOS! user over here, there are dozens of us). Guidance and teaching provided Rick, my sensei and friend. Additional learning from [FreeCodeCamp](freecodecamp.org) and [Coursera courses](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/). Also fueled by cheap coffee.

## Roadmap

- Add robust information about more areas, weapons and bosses from the series
- Create a gallery for personal screenshots for character builds, fashion, etc.
- Build out the site with new tricks as I learn them
